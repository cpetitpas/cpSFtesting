# Snowflake functional tests

Chris' repostitory for Snowflake tests

1. SNOWSQL queries for the tests
2. settings and setup files for the tests
3. Bash script which runs the tests

These tests assume that the basic SF environment variables are in place:
- SNOWSQL_USER - snowflake user login
- SNOWSQL_PWD - snowflake user password
- SNOWSQL_ACCOUNT - snowflake account (usually dr75630.us-east-1)
